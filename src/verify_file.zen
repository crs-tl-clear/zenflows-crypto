Scenario 'eddsa'
Given I have a 'eddsa public key'
and I have a 'eddsa signature'
and I have a 'url64' named 'hashedFile'
and I have a 'url64' named 'signed_hash'

When I create the hash of 'hashedFile'
and I verify 'hash' is equal to 'signed_hash'
When I verify the 'signed_hash' has a eddsa signature in 'eddsa signature' by 'client'

Then print the string 'signature is valid'
